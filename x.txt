At sufficient scale, tokenized assets could transmit volatility from crypto asset markets to the markets for the crypto token's reference assets.","title":"Tokenization: Overview and Financial Stability Implications","altText":null,"publishedAt":"2023-09-08T12:00:00.000Z","isFeatured":false,"tags":"Research","createdAt":"Fri Dec 01 2023 19:19:37 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","href":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/tokenization-overview-and-financial-stability-implications.htm","status":"PUBLISHED","author":"Federal Reserve"}},{"rank":3,"draftPost":null,"publishedPost":{"id":"121","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/daoza8wnr/image/upload/v1729338635/Untitled_design_6_idqui0.png","body":"Imagine a world where your money is no longer just a number in a bank account, but a digital token that can be programmed, transferred instantly, and used across various financial platforms.","title":"Money Tokens: The Digital Revolution Reshaping Money","altText":null,"publishedAt":"2024-10-18T12:00:00.000Z","isFeatured":false,"tags":"Article","createdAt":"Thu Oct 17 2024 23:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","href":"https://www.brettonwoods.org/article/money-tokens-the-digital-revolution-reshaping-money","status":"PUBLISHED","author":"Bretton Woods"}},{"rank":4,"draftPost":null,"publishedPost":{"id":"19","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/daoza8wnr/image/upload/v1701785886/Property_1_Bank_of_America_gh8zpm.png","body":"We are on the verge of an infrastructure evolution that may reshape how value is transferred, settled and stored across every industry.

Hi, we're Ondo Finance. Our mission is to provide institutional-grade, blockchain-enabled investment products and services. We have both a technology arm that develops decentralized finance technology, and an asset management arm that creates and manages tokenized funds. We were the first company to tokenize exposure to US Treasuries, and have since expanded into several other assets. We are also focused on incubating protocols that can support both tokenized real-world assets and traditional crypto.

Founded by folks from Goldman Sachs Digital Assets Team, weâ€™re backed by some of the best investors in the world including Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, Tiger Global, and more. We are currently the leaders in the space in terms of AUM and are well capitalized to continue to grow the firm. We're fully remote, with team members across the U.S.

About the Role

Weâ€™re looking for a Social Media & Community Lead to work closely with our leadership and communications teams at Ondo Finance. This role will be the driving force behind our voice on Twitter/X, LinkedIn and other key community channels, shaping how we engage with the crypto community, respond to hot-button issues, and share Ondoâ€™s story with the world. The ideal candidate is a seasoned crypto-native communicator who thrives in the fast-paced, ever-evolving landscape of decentralized finance. Prior experience working in web3 or finance is required, and an ability to work within strict legal guidelines is essential.

This person is a succinct writer and skilled communicator who can simplify complex concepts into viral messaging. We are specifically seeking candidates with an understanding of how blockchain and tokenization can be leveraged in industries such as financial services, investing, and DeFi. 

This role will report to our Head of Marketing and execute high-quality social content and community campaigns.

What Youâ€™ll Achieve:

â€¢Real-Time Communications: Own rapid-response messaging on social channels during opportune moments, high-profile events, and other time-sensitive situations.
â€¢Strategy & Execution: Develop and implement a forward-looking social media strategy that elevates our brand and leadersâ€™ voices while staying true to Ondoâ€™s mission and values.
â€¢Content Creation: Craft compelling, concise, and clear messaging that cuts through noise to deliver a resonant, authentic narrative.
â€¢Cross-Functional Alignment: Partner with executives, product teams, and marketing to align on big moments and critical priorities for Ondo.
â€¢Always On: Embrace the 24/7 nature of crypto. Be ready to pivot quickly and respond at a momentâ€™s notice â€” whenever and wherever needed.

Must-Haves:

â€¢Deep Social Savvy: A profound understanding of the social culture and current trends/news, with a focus on Twitter/X and other crypto-native platforms. Youâ€™ve lived and breathed crypto Twitter â€” you get the memes, the culture, and the ethos of this space.
â€¢Crypto Passion: A sincere belief in decentralized finance and the potential for onchain technology to reshape global finance.
â€¢Balance: Ability to balance engaging social communication with an institutional-grade brand and legal constraints.
â€¢Proven Social Track Record: Demonstrated success building, engaging, and growing a dedicated social following within the crypto ecosystem.
â€¢Resilient Under Fire: Able to take feedback and critique without losing composure. Youâ€™ll respond with a steady hand in even the most heated moments.
â€¢Partial (5hr) daily overlap with EST â€” typically this means you're located in the Americas unless you're willing to work unusual hours.

Nice-to-Haves:

â€¢Networked in Media: Existing relationships with prominent voices, community leaders, and media channels are a plus.
â€¢PR Experience: Understanding the art of public relations and ability to navigate reputational challenges gracefully.
â€¢Regulatory & Market Insight: Familiarity with the regulatory, security, and political landscapes shaping the future of DeFi and traditional finance.

What we offer:

â€¢Competitive compensation including salary, future token rights, and/or equity (according to your preferences) â€” we're well-funded and believe that great talent deserves great compensation
â€¢Full benefits (medical, vision, and dental) and flexible vacation policy (PTO)
â€¢Small remote-first team across many countries â€” you'll be an early team member helping shape our vision, culture, and design practices
â€¢A+ colleagues â€” our team includes alumni from: Goldman Sachs, Blackrock, Two Sigma, Bridgewater, SpaceX, AWS, Meta, Google, McKinsey, Circle, Uniswap
â€¢Best-in-class investors â€” we are proud to be backed by leading crypto experts and VCs, including Pantera Capital, Founders Fund and Coinbase Ventures

You should be familiar with onboarding and transaction UX in fintech as well as in web3, and feel comfortable with everything from in-product writing, working with user researchers and designing for a variety of audiences (ex. web3 degens, web2 retail users, institutions).

â€¢ Experience working closely with Product, Engineering and other cross-functional teams to co-own product strategy and roadmap
â€¢ Strong ownership mentality and ability to execute in fast-paced, ambiguous circumstances

Nice to haves:

â€¢ 1+ years of full-time web3 product designer experience
