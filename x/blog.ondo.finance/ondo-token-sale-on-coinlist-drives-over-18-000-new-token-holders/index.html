                <p><strong>We are excited to announce the sale of ONDO tokens via CoinList to over 18,000 purchasers. Over $10MM was raised via the sale across two tranches at a weighted average network valuation of $525MM.</strong></p><p>The success of the sale in these turbulent market conditions is a testament to the long-term orientation of our community. Over 4,000 network participants were given access to CoinList's "Priority Queue" based on their participation in, and contribution to, the Ondo community. The tokens were sold across two tranches with token-specific lock-ups that ranged between 18 and 30 months in total length, in addition to a global transfer restriction that must be waived by DAO governance for any tokens to be transferable.</p><p>The proceeds will be used to continue the development of Ondo as an open, decentralized investment bank. By automating and bringing typical investment banking services on-chain, Ondo is working to bridge the gap between TradFi and DeFi. </p><p>Combined with the $20MM raised earlier this year led by <a href="../ondo-raises-20m-in-series-a-investment-round-led-by-founders-fund-and-pantera-capital/index.html">Founders Fund</a> and <a href="../ondo-raises-20m-in-series-a-investment-round-led-by-founders-fund-and-pantera-capital/index.html">Pantera Capital</a>, and the $4MM raised last year led by <a href="../ondo-raises-4m-to-balance-risk-and-reward-for-the-defi-ecosystem/index.html">Pantera Capital</a>, we are well-positioned to continue building throughout the bear market.</p><p><strong>What is Ondo?</strong></p><p>Ondo Finance is building a decentralized investment bank. Like a traditional investment bank, Ondo aims to be a hub matching those who have capital with those who need it through the creation of customized financial products (e.g. equities, bonds, structured products, derivatives, etc.) that organizations can offer to investors to raise money. Historically, this work has often been highly manual, expensive, and reliant on intermediaries.</p><p>Decentralized finance (DeFi), however, presents novel infrastructure and financial primitives to enable investment banking activities that are automated, composable, and accessible to everyone. Ondo's focus is to build software that finds attractive investments across the traditional and DeFi landscape, repackages these assets into easily understood risk/reward offerings, and then matches and offers these assets to both institutional and retail investors.</p><p>For more information read our full documentation at <a href="https://docs.ondo.finance/?ref=blog.ondo.finance">https://docs.ondo.finance/</a>. You can access the Ondo web application at <a href="https://ondo.finance/?ref=blog.ondo.finance">https://ondo.finance/</a>.</p><blockquote>We are hiring across engineering, product, and operations, and are especially focused on building out our new capital markets team, which is focused on adding traditional forms of credit into our products. You can see open roles here: <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/ondofinance?ref=blog.ondo.finance">https://jobs.lever.co/ondofinance</a></blockquote><p><strong>Behind Ondo</strong></p><p>Ondo is being developed by a team of traditional banking veterans and DeFi experts. Our team includes alumni from Goldman Sachs Digital Assets and Blockchain R&amp;D, Facebook, Microsoft, Symbiont, BadgerDAO, private equity funds, hedge funds, and various venture-backed start-ups.</p><p>If you haven’t already done so, we’d love you to join our growing community on Discord, <a href="https://t.me/ondocommunity?ref=blog.ondo.finance">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OndoFinance?ref=blog.ondo.finance">Twitter</a>.</p><p><strong>Legal Disclaimers</strong></p><p><em>This announcement has been written and published by Ondo Finance Inc. and provides no guarantee, commitment, or undertaking to utilize any of its assets, funds, properties or personnel, Ondo Protocol users or other protocol participants.
