In a <a href="https://blog.ondo.finance/global-markets/"><u>recent post</u></a>, we discussed how our Ondo Global Markets platform is being designed to fulfill that promise. However, as we began fleshing out the design of Ondo Global Markets* over the past year and spent time with institutional partners like broker-dealers, we realized that today&#x2019;s public blockchains just didn&#x2019;t have the features and capabilities necessary to truly make this vision a reality.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why, over the past year or so, we&#x2019;ve been working hard to develop not only the Ondo Global Markets platform but also the infrastructure to support it. Today, after months of work, we&#x2019;re excited to finally be able to share more detail about our solution to these challenges: </p><p><strong>Ondo Chain, our new L1 blockchain purpose-built for institutional-grade RWAs.</strong></p><p>In this post, we lay out what we see as the biggest infrastructure barriers to enabling widespread use of tokenized securities, explain how Ondo Chain addresses these issues, and discuss some of the benefits and use cases that this will enable, ultimately paving the way for a more open, efficient, and inclusive financial system.</p><h2 id="current-barriers">Current Barriers</h2><p>There are several infrastructure barriers that need to be addressed to enable Ondo Global Markets and other efforts to create and use tokenized regulated securities at scale:</p><ul><li><strong>Incompatibility with DeFi. </strong>DeFi was not built with public securities in mind. Bringing public securities onchain in a way that is compatible with DeFi presents many obstacles, particularly related to corporate actions, such as forward and reverse stock splits, which can have a dramatic impact on the price of an asset. In TradFi, investors are compensated by receiving more or fewer shares (similar to an onchain rebase), but this method does not work well for most DeFi implementations. Oracle design for thousands of public securities also requires a new scalable approach to bring data onchain in a secure and economical fashion.</li><li><strong>Cross-Chain Liquidity Fragmentation. </strong>Onchain capital and users are increasingly multichain, necessitating the need to issue RWAs across chains. However, issuance across chains fragments liquidity and increases the complexity of asset management for any asset issuer. In turn, this increases the importance of bridging, but opens the asset issuer up to significant risks. Bridging adds new points of failure in the system, such as erroneous token mints on a compromised chain or a bridge hack. Cross-chain messaging for omnichain asset issuance, management and distribution needs institutional grade bridging security - reliance on a single bridging provider is not tenable.</li><li><strong>High (and Often Volatile) Transaction Fees</strong>. On many proof-of-stake blockchains, transaction fees are often paid with the network&apos;s native token (e.g. ETH on Ethereum). Because the price of this token can be volatile, the cost to complete a transaction can sometimes be quite high. Compounding this issue, on many chains this same token is also the same one staked by validators to ensure network security.&#xA0; Since validators bear risk by doing this (since these volatile tokens could easily lose value while staked), validators require compensation for doing so; this compensation must be paid by the network from money earned from the transaction fees it charges, further increasing transaction costs.</li><li><strong>Inadequate Network, Bridging, and Protocol Security.</strong> The dynamics described in the previous point often make network security expensive. Relying solely on a native token to secure a network that has a high total value of RWAs issued on it is also risky: on average, RWA volatility is significantly lower than crypto volatility, so during bear markets the network security can quickly fall below the required threshold. The same is true for any dApp, oracle, or bridge that holds meaningful RWAs, but is secured by its native token. Institutional-grade onchain capital markets require a more stable and robust security model.</li><li><strong>Institutional Regulatory Concerns.</strong> In order to bring this new world to fruition, we must have traditional asset managers participate. But many regulated institutions are precluded from transacting on public blockchains, limiting the capital flows into the onchain ecosystem. While regulation differs by country, many concerns relate to an inability to hold or transact crypto assets (making it challenging to pay gas fees and run nodes) and the risk of malicious MEV or being &#x201C;front run&#x201D;, as many most broker-dealers need to guarantee &#x201C;best execution&#x201D; for their clients. To bring institutional-grade capital markets onchain, institutions need to have their legal and regulatory concerns addressed.</li></ul><p>Historically, many of these issues, such as network security and institutional restrictions have been addressed through the use of permissioned blockchains where all validators are known entities and the entire system is closed. However, it is precisely the closed-off nature of these networks that nullifies what we see as one of the most compelling promises of blockchain technology: an open, global, and transparent financial system that can be accessed permissionlessly by developers and investors alike. What&#x2019;s needed is a solution that combines the best of public <em>and</em> permissioned chains while addressing all the issues above.Ondo Chain has been designed from the ground up to do exactly this.</p><h2 id="ondo-chain-overview">Ondo Chain Overview</h2><p>Ondo Chain is a Layer 1 proof-of-stake blockchain purpose-built to accelerate the creation of institutional-grade financial markets onchain. By combining the openness of public blockchains with the compliance and security features of permissioned chains, Ondo Chain provides the infrastructure to enable tokenized real-world assets to be used at scale.</p><p>Ondo Chain will provide native support for tokenized RWAs, such as Ondo GM-issued tokens, ensuring they are seamlessly integrated into all aspects of the blockchain&apos;s functionality and ecosystem. RWAs like Ondo GM tokens will be used to secure the network, the oracles, and the bridges. Ondo GM tokens will have their collateral verified on an ongoing basis by the Ondo Chain validator nodes. The Ondo Chain DeFi ecosystem will be designed to support corporate actions and other unique requirements imposed by RWAs. And finally, Ondo GM tokens can natively be used for margin, sourced in traditional finance or DeFi.&#xA0;</p><p>In addition, Ondo Chain will enable asset managers to create omnichain RWAs and manage them effectively. Ondo Chain has been designed for a multichain world, providing institutional-grade security for cross-chain messaging and bridging, allowing it to act as a hub connecting assets and applications across other public and private blockchains.</p><h2 id="features">Features</h2><ul><li><strong>Institutional-Grade Network Security via RWAs: </strong>Ondo Chain validators will be able to stake any eligible asset(s) as decided upon by chain-level governance. We anticipate Ondo Chain will support the staking of Ondo GM tokens and other high quality liquid assets. By supporting staking of existing assets that are widely held and already pay a yield, particularly RWAs, Ondo Chain can achieve high security at a relatively low cost to validators, while offering additional yield opportunities (e.g. from transaction fees) on top of these otherwise idle but yield-bearing assets. Requiring validators to stake exogenous assets to align incentives is analogous in principle to the way the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) requires broker-dealers to post high-quality collateral to ensure the integrity of the clearing and settlement process. In both cases, participants have strong incentives to behave properly or risk losing their collateral.</li><li><strong>Permissioned Validators: </strong>To uphold integrity and compliance with institutional requirements, validators on Ondo Chain will be permissioned and subject to continuous monitoring, specifically to mitigate their engagement in malicious MEV. This setup creates a fair and secure environment for all participants and makes Ondo Chain suitable for institutions who often can&#x2019;t pay transaction fees to unknown validators and who, in certain contexts, must provide best execution for and prevent front-running of client transactions. By combining a permissioned validator set with RWA staking, institutional capital can be used to secure not only the network but also other critical components (e.g. bridges, oracles, etc.). </li><li><strong>Connectivity Into Institutional Networks.</strong> A subset of Ondo Chain validators will be run by select financial institutions, allowing them to more easily connect Ondo Chain into their private networks and TradFi environments. This decreases latency for transactions involving assets at those institutions and enables access to additional assets and liquidity only available on their systems.</li><li><strong>Scalable and Secure Data Feeds via Enshrined Oracles: </strong>Beyond validating blockchain transactions, in Ondo Chain, validators will also publish key offchain data&#x2014;including asset prices, interest rates, market indices, and the like&#x2014;ensuring that only accurate, trusted and real-time information is published onchain. This greatly reduces the risk of manipulation or errors that could impact the security or accuracy of onchain transactions, while improving scalability as the value of investments and the number of assets and key data points grows.</li><li><strong>Native Omnichain Messaging and Bridging:</strong> Ondo Chain natively incorporates the <a href="https://docs.ondo.finance/tools/ondo-bridge?ref=blog.ondo.finance"><u>Ondo Bridge</u></a>, making it possible to bridge tokens or pass general messages to other chains without being susceptible to the hacking or failure of any single third-party message protocol or blockchain. Primary security will be provided by the Ondo Chain validators that run their own decentralized verifier network (DVN), with <em>additional</em> DVNs used at higher transaction amounts. Ondo Chain will also make it easy for developers to create natively omnichain applications by acting as the &#x2018;source of truth&#x2019; for key pieces of information (e.g. KYC status, sanction lists, collateral amounts, etc.) across supported chains.</li><li><strong>Enshrined Proof of Reserves and Collateral: </strong>A subset of Ondo Chain validators will automatically verify directly with custodians or broker dealers that the balances of every RWA token as reported by the token minter are fully backed by the appropriate amount and type of underlying assets. This process mitigates risks of under-collateralization or misreporting, which can lead to insolvency or loss of user trust in the system. This approach shifts the responsibility from a single centralized minter to a distributed network of validators, increasing transparency and reducing the risk of fraud. By empowering validators to govern these processes, Ondo Chain can maintain a more secure, decentralized, and transparent issuance of tokenized assets, fostering greater confidence among institutional and retail participants alike.</li><li><strong>Open Access and Development. </strong>Although validators on Ondo Chain will be permissioned, the rest of the chain will be open, allowing anyone to issue tokens, develop apps, or act as a user or investor. User identification and permissions will be core features of Ondo Chain, allowing asset issuers and application developers to implement permissioning and transfer restrictions at a contract level where appropriate.</li><li><strong>Native DeFi Support for RWAs:</strong> Developers will be able to easily develop DeFi apps with full, native support for RWAs, enabling them to be used for borrowing, lending, and staking.</li><li><strong>Institutional-Grade Governance:</strong> The governance of Ondo Chain will be decentralized, with stakeholders selecting permissioned governance committee members, who will include financial institutions acting as permissioned validators on Ondo Chain. This two-tier governance structure ensures that the platform aligns with the community&apos;s interests and remains adaptable to the evolving blockchain landscape. We believe that Ondo Chain should be governed by and act as an industry utility for those who use it the most. This is not dissimilar to how institutional utilities like the DTCC are self-governing and for-profit but also initialized by and owned primarily by those who use it the most. In the case of Ondo Chain, users include not just large institutions but also global individuals.</li></ul><p>Through these features, Ondo Chain will provide infrastructure purpose built for the tokenization of RWAs while catering to the comprehensive needs of both traditional and crypto-native investors. By combining the strengths of public and permissioned blockchains, Ondo Chain aims to foster a thriving ecosystem where the potential of tokenized RWAs is fully realized.</p><h2 id="comparison-with-other-solutions">Comparison with Other Solutions</h2><p>Ondo Chain builds on almost a decade of lessons from the industry regarding the use of blockchain technology in regulated financial applications. It combines elements of permissioned enterprise blockchains, public blockchains, and bridging technology to create infrastructure for enabling institutional-grade financial markets to migrate onchain.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Compared to most public, permissionless chains</strong>, Ondo Chain:</p><ul><li>Is uniquely focused in its ecosystem and incentives around the use of (liquid) RWAs in DeFi.</li><li>Enables regulated institutional participation and seamless connectivity into TradFi liquidity.&#xA0;&#xA0;</li><li>Prevents front-running and enhances investor protections by allowing only known, permissioned entities to run validators.&#xA0;</li><li>Is secured by a basket of high-quality liquid exogenous assets, improving security while reducing costs.&#xA0;&#xA0;</li><li>Enables gas fees to be paid in RWAs, enhancing UX and enabling regulated institutions to transact onchain.</li></ul><p><strong>Compared to permissioned, enterprise chains</strong>, Ondo Chain:</p><ul><li>Allows open access, use, and development.</li><li>Enables the development of an open, robust DeFi ecosystem across asset classes (including crypto).</li><li>Enables native bridging to other chains.</li><li>Eliminates silos and connects liquidity venues.</li><li>Expands access to high-quality RWAs to investors across the world.	&#xA0;</li></ul><p><strong>Compared to stand-alone bridging solutions</strong>, Ondo Chain:</p><ul><li>Is an L1 chain with its own state and logic.</li><li>Is secured by institutional participants and staked RWAs.</li><li>Has native integrations into TradFi networks that enable lower cost and latency while enabling real-time liquidity.</li></ul><h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2><p>As mentioned, Ondo Chain has been designed with the explicit goal of supporting institutional-grade financial markets onchain. When complete, here are just some of the use cases we expect Ondo Chain to enable:</p><ul><li><strong>Prime Brokerage.</strong> Access margin on both RWAs and crypto (including with cross-collateralization) from both onchain and off-chain sources at competitive rates. Buy and sell from broker-dealers obligated to provide best execution, and receive competitive securities lending rates when you loan out your assets.</li><li><strong>Staking and Collateral</strong>. Easily stake tokenized RWAs like Ondo GM assets on Ondo Chain to enhance chain security and receive rewards.&#xA0; Post as collateral for borrowing and other uses. </li><li><strong>Onchain Wealth Management.</strong> Easily build and/or utilize onchain asset management strategies, including automatic 24/7 portfolio rebalancing across crypto, stocks, bonds, and ETFs.</li><li><strong>Cross-Chain Token Issuance.</strong> Issue tokens that automatically work on multiple chains. Set conditions that must be met for bridging to take place. Manage and administer the assets seamlessly across chains.</li><li><strong>Stablecoin Distribution and Yield.</strong> Distribute stablecoins secured by tokenized securities across various supported blockchains and easily track minting and yield attribution.</li><li><strong>Bootstrapping Other Networks and Protocols</strong>: Use restaked Ondo Chain RWAs to secure a new chain or protocol while the native token and network matures.</li></ul><h2 id="future-state">Future State</h2><p>If we are successful, we believe that creating Ondo Chain will have the following benefits that could not be achieved with any existing blockchains:</p><ol><li><strong>A Seamless and Cost-Effective Investor Experience</strong></li></ol><p>By tightly coupling onchain and off-chain infrastructure, we can eliminate the need for fragmented solutions for oracles, bridging, chain security, and more. With Ondo Chain, validators will provide <em>all</em> these functions, reducing costs and enhancing security. Additionally, certain critical operations, such as token minting upon confirmation of a securities purchase on a traditional exchange, benefit from the lowest possible latency and risk when the broker-dealers themselves act as validators.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Attracting Traditional Distribution Partners and Asset Suppliers</strong></li></ol><p>Tokenizing securities and other RWAs on a &quot;public permissioned&quot; chain&#x2014;operated by financial institutions themselves&#x2014;provides the trust, compliance, and institutional familiarity needed to onboard broker-dealers and asset managers. This alignment creates the network effects and broad adoption required to make onchain capital markets a viable evolution of traditional finance.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Unified Focus and Incentive Alignment</strong></li></ol><p>A dedicated ecosystem built around RWAs in DeFi allows for concentrated development of wallets, protocols, and applications tailored to the unique needs of financial markets. This unified focus fosters innovation, maximizes utility, and ensures that every participant in the ecosystem is aligned and incentivized to advance the use of tokenized assets.</p><p>Ondo Chain represents our commitment to combining the best of DeFi with the best of TradFi. By addressing the fundamental barriers to onchain capital markets, it creates the foundation for a truly open, accessible, and efficient financial system.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-capital-markets-onchain">The Future of Capital Markets, Onchain</h2><p>We believe that Ondo Chain represents a significant step forward in the evolution of institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure. By combining the openness of public blockchains with the compliance and security features of permissioned chains, Ondo Chain bridges the gap between traditional and decentralized finance, creating an ecosystem where participants can leverage the best of both worlds.</p><p>By enabling seamless interaction between tokenized assets, DeFi protocols, and traditional market participants, Ondo Chain paves the way for transformative use cases like cross-chain asset issuance, enhanced capital efficiency through better borrowing and lending mechanisms, and new opportunities to generate yield from tokenized real-world assets. These use cases, along with others, provide incentives for institutions to begin participating more actively on public blockchains while providing individuals with access to financial tools traditionally reserved for large-scale investors. Together, these advancements will create a more integrated, dynamic, and inclusive financial ecosystem, setting the stage for the widespread adoption of onchain capital markets.</p><p>As we move forward, we invite developers, asset managers, and other market participants to join us in shaping this new ecosystem. Together, we can unlock the full potential of tokenized assets and enable a financial system that is more efficient, secure, and accessible to all.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/02/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing Ondo Chain: The Omnichain Network for RWAs" loading="lazy" width="1598" height="223" srcset="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image.png 600w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image.png 1000w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/02/image.png 1598w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[USDY Goes Live on BitGo's Go Network: Bringing Yield to Institutional Balances]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/02/USDY-Disclaimer---When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned--1-.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1476" height="264" srcset="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/USDY-Disclaimer---When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned--1-.png 600w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/USDY-Disclaimer---When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/02/USDY-Disclaimer---When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned--1-.png 1476w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Ondo is bringing USDY, our United States Dollar Yield token, to BitGo&#x2019;s Go Network, a secure, real-time, settlement platform, bringing flexible cash management tools to institutional finance, with over 1,500 participating institutions and enterprises enrolled in the Go Network.

This article continues that series.</em></p><p>The current investing experience is broken. High fees, limited access, transfer frictions, platform fragmentation, and hidden risks create barriers for both investors and the companies that serve them. These problems have persisted for decades, locking millions out of capital markets and stifling innovation.</p><p>At Ondo, we believe there&#x2019;s a better way. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can bring institutional-grade financial markets onchain, making them more accessible, transparent, and efficient. That&#x2019;s why, last year, we announced our intention to build what we call Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM), a tokenization platform designed to bring public securities onchain.</p><p>As we described last year, when we first began thinking about how to tokenize exposure to publicly traded securities, we knew we needed to design the tokens to have the same liquidity as the underlying assets. Initially, we planned to achieve this through a model where tokens would represent client instructions at traditional broker-dealers, in what would have been a fully permissioned system.</p><p>However, as we spoke more with key stakeholders&#x2014;developers, TradFi partners, and current and former government officials&#x2014;it became clear that the community was becoming increasingly ready to unlock the full potential of blockchain technology for financial markets through a more open and accessible design, with stablecoins as a key reference point.</p><p>Behind this momentum, we reimagined the Ondo GM tokenization framework, which now will enable issuers to create tokens that are more freely transferable, similar to stablecoins&#x2014;with permissioning built into the distribution layer as needed for participants&#x2019; compliance, security or commercial purposes.</p><p>In this framework, Ondo GM will propel financial markets into the open economy, returning power to stakeholders to make their own decisions and compete on a level playing field, while addressing challenges like high fees, limited availability, and transfer frictions.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why, today, we&#x2019;re excited to share the next evolution of our Ondo Global Markets platform&#x2014;with a tokenization framework that combines stablecoin-modeled transferability with the liquidity we have always envisioned. <strong>What stablecoins did for dollars, Ondo GM will do for securities.</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdLzO_eZnvv_MWCDglzwV-TAD81ra7o5OEkQogW8E-L6TI-asWnOrZ6CJ5vbiW3o0WbCv6Nx52BtveUxeZ6ETXYPHkqsV_WeUOixDCzuvvhFqOdsH0PkoVnw8qNGGlXz1_rfPPQ4Q?key=PWFAw06vZvufa4aawhiCKJ9P" class="kg-image" alt="Ondo Global Markets: Wall Street, Meet DeFi" loading="lazy" width="624" height="296"></figure><h2 id="global-markets-overview"><strong>Global Markets Overview</strong></h2><p>At its core, Ondo Global Markets is a tokenization platform that enables investors outside the US to gain onchain exposure to thousands of US publicly traded securities, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs. Tokens issued in the Ondo GM platform will be each backed 1:1 by an underlying asset, like a public stock, and will be freely transferable, like stablecoins, outside the US. By providing tokenized exposure to these assets, Ondo Global Markets brings the transparency, efficiency, and accessibility enabled by blockchain technology to institutional-grade finance. Through its APIs and SDKs, the platform also empowers third-party developers to build innovative financial applications, making it a cornerstone for the next generation of financial services.</p><p>Ondo Global Markets is designed to provide benefits to a wide range of stakeholders, including retail and institutional investors, traditional financial institutions, and crypto ecosystem participants:&#xA0;</p><ul><li><strong>Individual investors</strong> outside the US can gain extremely low friction exposure to US securities in a manner that is as easy as acquiring a stablecoin, unlocking global participation in sometimes hard-to-access markets. These investors can also tap into onchain financial services across lending, trading, and derivatives, in many cases with rates typically only available to institutional investors.</li><li><strong>Traditional broker-dealers </strong>outside the US can leverage Ondo Global Markets as an alternative means of providing their clients with exposure to US securities, dramatically reducing operational complexity and cost compared to traditional brokerage-as-a-service alternatives. By integrating Ondo GM, these broker-dealers can also provide their users with services enabled by third-party protocols. </li><li><strong>Asset managers and other issuers</strong> gain a new distribution channel to a more global and onchain world of investors, and the ability to bring new assets onchain. Investment advisers, including robo-advisors, can also leverage onchain financial infrastructure to transparently manage funds backed by tokenized securities.</li><li><strong>Existing crypto-focused platforms, including wallets, protocols, and exchanges</strong> benefit from the ability to offer their users, in many cases for the first time ever, exposure to high-quality traditional securities that have historically been unavailable onchain (subject to applicable regulatory requirements). Users of these platforms may be particularly drawn to the ability to leverage crypto and securities together, such as for loans and derivatives positions with cross-collateralization.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdEWHp6cHG62OzkcWGuvHRd2SiUJnSvmLFx5W5qpFXJim018GsfP4kH4gfl-GEN-FXY-HemDr9YePosP2Jdfc4Q67lvn8Ca9823iFw6VExbFFUnbPrUDIWQYhAs7x1jSshff-DP4A?key=PWFAw06vZvufa4aawhiCKJ9P" class="kg-image" alt="Ondo Global Markets: Wall Street, Meet DeFi" loading="lazy" width="624" height="271"></figure><h2 id="features"><strong>Features</strong></h2><p>Here&#x2019;s some of the key features the Ondo GM platform&#x2014;and our web app&#x2014;will offer:</p><ul><li><strong>Broad Access to Thousands of RWAs: </strong>Gain exposure to over one thousand high-quality securities listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, including equity and fixed-income ETFs (e.g., SPY, QQQ, TLT) and individual stocks of companies like Apple, Tesla, and Uber. Each token is backed 1:1 by the security it tracks.</li><li><strong>Global, 24/7/365 Availability</strong>: Mint, redeem, and transfer tokens from anywhere in the world (outside the US) at any time , ensuring continuous access to high-quality RWAs.</li><li><strong>Instant Minting &amp; Redemption: </strong>Mint and redeem tokenized securities instantly.</li><li><strong>Full Liquidity</strong>: Ondo GM assets are designed to have the same liquidity as the underlying security, allowing for immediate, low-slippage buying and selling.</li><li><strong>Built-In Access to Margin</strong>: Borrow against tokenized holdings at competitive rates typically accessible only to traditional institutional investors.</li><li><strong>Onchain Financial Services:</strong> Tap into a wide range of onchain financial protocols across trading, lending, and derivatives, applying the transparency and composability of DeFi to traditional assets.</li><li><strong>Additional Yield Opportunities.</strong> Earn novel sources of yield by pledging tokens as collateral to secure onchain financial infrastructure, including chains, oracles, and bridges.</li><li><strong>Freely Transferrable Tokens:</strong> Transfer tokens freely on secondary markets outside the US, utilizing them across various onchain protocols and wallets without any platform lock-in.&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Institutional-Grade Investor Protections: </strong>Benefit from robust legal structures designed to maximize bankruptcy remoteness while providing token holders with security interests in the assets that back tokens.&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Income from Securities Lending: </strong>Earn additional income by opting in to allow the securities that back your tokens to be lent out in the institutional securities lending marketplace, while avoiding the added risk by knowing your securities won&#x2019;t be lent out unless you explicitly opt in.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive APIs: </strong>Integrate with powerful APIs that let brokers, asset issuers, and other platforms build on top of Ondo GM, reducing costs, modernizing back-end infrastructure, and enhancing user experiences.</li></ul><h2 id="solving-the-challenges-of-traditional-capital-markets">Solving the Challenges of Traditional Capital Markets</h2><p>With the above features, it should be clear that Ondo GM was designed from the beginning to address many of the issues that end investors face in today&#x2019;s traditional capital markets:</p><p><strong>Accessibility and Cost</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Problem</strong>: Many investors around the world face hurdles accessing US financial products and services. Even when able to access them, brokerage platforms often require high minimum balances or fees, making investing impractical for many.</li><li><strong>The Solution</strong>: With Ondo GM, anyone outside the US in eligible geographies can get exposure to thousands of US securities&#x2014;AAPL, TSLA, SPY, QQQ, etc.&#x2014;with minimal fees using stablecoins, removing traditional cost and geographic barriers.</li></ul><p><strong>Platform Lock-In</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Problem</strong>: Those investors who do manage to get an account with access to US capital markets experience a high degree of lock in to a specific platform. The platform determines your monthly fees, your trading fees, your access to specific products (e.g., Vanguard funds vs. BlackRock funds, crypto vs. equities, etc.) and services, and the margin rates you receive on your capital. Changing platforms is possible, but broker to broker transfers are very cumbersome and slow.</li><li><strong>The Solution</strong>: Ondo GM tokens are freely transferable outside the US, allowing investors to easily transfer their holdings to any wallet or platform (including protocols) at any time. Transfers happen instantly, 24/7/365, eliminating platform lock-in and enabling a seamless, global investing experience across platforms. You can also easily use different protocols for trade execution, leverage, and other services, and you can compose different activities from different protocols together (taking advantage of the &#x201C;money legos&#x201D; that DeFi is well-known for).&#xA0;&#xA0;</li></ul><p><strong>Platform Fragmentation</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Problem: </strong>Securities held at different brokerages are generally not interoperable. For example, for a retail investor, there isn&#x2019;t a great way to cross-collateralize a loan or derivatives position with assets held at different brokerages (let alone with assets held at different brokerages, banks, crypto exchanges, etc.). This stems in part from the fact that different platforms hold user balances on siloed books and records.</li><li><strong>The Solution:</strong> Ownership of Ondo GM tokens is recorded on the blockchain, and with your approval, you can grant different platforms the ability to buy, sell, lend, borrow, and take other actions utilizing your assets. Your assets are truly interoperable and you do things like take out a leveraged trade cross-collateralized by your assets held at a variety of different locations.</li></ul><p><strong>Limited and Costly Margin</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Problem</strong>: For many retail investors outside the US, margin options&#x2014;the ability to borrow money against your portfolio&#x2014;are particularly expensive and limited (if available at all). For investors who hold both traditional and crypto assets, it&#x2019;s often not possible to borrow against one set of assets in order to purchase assets in the other. Additionally, due to platform lock-in, investors aren&#x2019;t able to easily shop for different margin rates unless they want to change brokerages entirely.</li><li><strong>The Solution</strong>: Ondo GM integrates institutional-grade borrowing options directly into its platform. Investors can borrow against their tokenized holdings via third party protocols or directly via the Ondo GM platform. Investors can also cross-collateralize their positions by tokenized securities as well as crypto.</li></ul><p><strong>Hidden Risks</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Problem</strong>: Many platforms lend out client securities without clear disclosure, exposing investors to hidden risks. Yield from these activities often goes entirely to the platform, not the client.</li><li><strong>The Solution</strong>: Securities are never lent out without explicit investor permission &#x2014; and for clients who opt in, they earn 100% of the yield generated.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcC2zkEJ8p4RbJi_j2vlzQlAjl7ZhmYsNfR-ndw86gDl6NF5WjHJyrYASmYqM4GciARO9YFWcfCsDmEzzB1mOSdr1PIfmILVSScpC67cC2I6nfkh5xB7oONH5HtioPMWPLxQNOsNQ?key=PWFAw06vZvufa4aawhiCKJ9P" class="kg-image" alt="Ondo Global Markets: Wall Street, Meet DeFi" loading="lazy" width="624" height="296"></figure><h2 id="us-markets-global-access">US Markets. Global Access.</h2><p>While the Ondo GM platform is certainly not limited to tokenizing US securities, it&#x2019;s no accident that we&#x2019;re starting here. In many respects, US capital markets are the envy of the world: over the past 25 years, US public securities have outperformed nearly every other major market by a considerable margin. US equities historically have also acted as an effective inflation hedge, far outpacing global inflation by about 4.5% on average over the past 50 years. While the US dollar is often in the spotlight due to its position as the world&#x2019;s reserve currency, it is US capital markets (along with crypto more recently) that have been the real driver of wealth creation long term. By increasing accessibility to high-quality US financial assets and services, we believe Ondo GM will mark a significant step forward in making markets more open to all.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeI0wr9WiBo4oywwLJ571XHKd0CdT1Bc7PxIDyGmMwyIxHqn4DUbBlLxzp0nxjCgivtHViEuZo0TaTWzEUVvESLKQCO6xfq92mkaruL3Bt3BKiGkMr_5bmNM7M8hvef7g39Subprw?key=PWFAw06vZvufa4aawhiCKJ9P" class="kg-image" alt="Ondo Global Markets: Wall Street, Meet DeFi" loading="lazy" width="624" height="333"></figure><h2 id="a-new-era-of-investing">A New Era of Investing</h2><p>We intend to launch Global Markets this year. When we do, we will take a significant step toward our goal of making capital markets accessible to everyone and catalyzing the growth of the open economy.&#xA0;</p><p>But that&#x2019;s not all.</p><p>In the process of figuring out how to best achieve our ultimate goal, we realized two additional points. First, given the unique challenges associated with tokenizing RWAs, the infrastructure to ensure the level of security, reliability, compliance, cost, and convenience we wanted doesn&#x2019;t yet exist. Second, bringing financial markets onchain is too big an undertaking to do by ourselves: it takes the support and work of many key partners to build an <em>ecosystem</em> to help bring this all to life.</p><p>Over the past year or so, we&#x2019;ve been working hard to bring together all <em>three</em> pieces&#x2014;not just the <em>assets</em>, but also the <em>infrastructure</em> and the <em>ecosystem</em>&#x2014;to make this vision a reality. In the next few days, we&#x2019;ll be making a major announcement that will tie all of these pieces together and lay out our full vision for the future of financial markets. Stay tuned.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Designing for the Open Economy: Our New Visual Identity]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Today, we&#x2019;re thrilled to unveil a new visual identity that brings to life our bold vision for the future of tokenization and the open economy.<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular" data-kg-thumbnail="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/media/2025/02/Ondo-Rebrand_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail>

There are a few reasons for this. First, in talking to our stakeholders, we felt that the logo already had such strong brand recognition that changing it risked confusing our users. Second, given how much the <em>other</em> elements of our visual identity were changing, we wanted to provide some sense of continuity. Third, we all just already liked it. &#x2018;Ondo&#x2018; means &#x2018;wave&#x2019; in esperanto; this was both a reference to the fact that Nathan (our founder) was born in Hawaii, and an allusion to what we saw as the &#x2018;coming wave&#x2019; of tokenization as assets move onto the blockchain.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/02/Ondo-Logo---Rebrand-Blog.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designing for the Open Economy: Our New Visual Identity" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Ondo-Logo---Rebrand-Blog.png 600w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Ondo-Logo---Rebrand-Blog.png 1000w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/02/Ondo-Logo---Rebrand-Blog.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Beyond our logo, however, many other aspects of our visual identity <em>have</em> been updated. Let&#x2019;s take a look.</p><h2 id="photography">Photography</h2><p>When you visit our new site, the first thing you&#x2019;ll notice is that there is a lot more photography. As a company focused on bringing financial markets onchain&#x2014;that is, connecting the <em>real world</em> to the <em>blockchain</em> one&#x2014;we wanted to highlight more of this connection to the physical world and the people in it. Many blockchain companies&#x2019; websites are very &#x2018;tech-y&#x2019; and abstract; while this may be appropriate for them, we ultimately see blockchain technology not as an end in its own right, but as a tool to help improve things in the <em>real world</em> for <em>real people.</em> For that reason, much of the photography you&#x2019;ll see is of people. The other type of photography you&#x2019;ll see frequently is of buildings and cityscapes, with a particular emphasis on shots that convey a sense of space. We did this to represent our emphasis on accelerating the transition to the <em>open</em> (i.e. space) <em>economy</em> (i.e. buildings, ports, people, etc.).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular" data-kg-thumbnail="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/media/2025/02/Ondo-New-Homepage_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail>

Leveraging OUSG&#x2019;s instant minting and redemption capabilities, Ondo Nexus enhances the liquidity and utility of tokenized Treasuries while building foundational infrastructure for the broader RWA category. As part of this initiative, Ondo is diversifying the backing of OUSG to include tokenized Treasuries from Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, Wellington Management and Fundbridge Capital, while leveraging the 24/7 liquidity available through existing relationships with BlackRock, PayPal, and others.&#xA0;</p><p><em>&#x201C;Ondo Nexus represents the next step in advancing tokenized Treasuries and the broader RWA category,&#x201D; </em>said Nathan Allman, CEO of Ondo Finance. <em>&#x201C;We are excited to further strengthen our relationships with Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, Wellington Management and Fundbridge Capital, while driving the convergence between traditional finance and DeFi. By diversifying our eligible collateral, we are building modular infrastructure that enables shared redeemability of tokenized Treasuries to stablecoins across products and supports a wide range of future tokenized financial offerings</em>.&#x201D;</p><p>Ondo Finance remains the only provider of tokenized Treasuries offering 24/7 redemptions at no cost to investors. Currently, OUSG allows redemptions against USDC, with PayPal USD (PYUSD) expected to be added soon. With Ondo Nexus, investors in tokenized Treasuries from partner issuers will be able to seamlessly redeem their assets against a variety of stablecoins, enhancing liquidity and utility across the ecosystem.&#xA0;</p><p>This infrastructure dramatically enhances the utility of tokenized Treasuries, advancing the investability of the RWA space and instilling greater confidence in the liquidity of onchain holdings. The tokenized Treasuries category surpassed $3 billion in total value locked (TVL) in 2024, making it the fastest-growing segment within the RWA ecosystem.</p><p><strong>About Ondo Finance</strong></p><p>Ondo is a blockchain technology company.

Yet despite these advancements, significant limitations persist: high costs, limited transparency, slow settlement, restricted market hours, and siloed systems that fragment user experiences and constrain innovation.</p><p>These limitations have consequences. Consider the experience of a Millennial investor here in the US. She might have cash at Bank of America and Chase, meme stocks at Robinhood, mutual funds in her retirement account at Fidelity, a diversified portfolio at Wealthfront, leveraged stocks at Interactive Brokers, and crypto at Coinbase. For her, trying to move assets between these platforms is difficult and slow. Even just getting a &#x2018;unified view&#x2019; of all her assets is difficult. And if she wants to cross-collateralize her assets held on different platforms or shop around for the best leverage rates? Good luck. Each of these platforms keeps records of user ownership in siloed systems, while the underlying bank deposits, securities, and crypto settle on a distinct set of rails. This fragmentation makes the entire experience cumbersome, costly, and slow.</p><p>While these challenges are frustrating and expensive for those of us in developed markets, the consequences for many people globally are far more severe. Billions of people around the world lack access to high-quality financial assets altogether, leaving them excluded from the benefits of modern finance.</p><p>While the fintech sector has improved the investor experience through automation of certain processes and better user interfaces, the problems above are fundamentally caused by limitations at the infrastructure layer and therefore are not well-suited to be solved by building on top of these existing systems. We believe that public blockchains and DeFi are best suited to address these issues while providing additional, novel features like programmability and composability.</p><p>As we thought deeply about the <em>benefits</em> of solving these issues, however, we came to believe that ultimately most of the benefits of public blockchains and DeFi come down to one thing&#x2014;<strong>access</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Access</strong> to capital <em>wherever</em> you are, enabled by better distributional infrastructure, including digital bearer assets like stablecoins.</li><li><strong>Access</strong> to financial <em>products and services</em> previously only available to wealthy or institutional clients, enabled by smart contract-based protocols.</li><li><strong>Access</strong> to <em>custody and control</em> of your assets, enabled by the use of private keys.</li><li>The ability to <em>grant</em> <em>or revoke</em> <strong>access</strong> to your assets for various DeFi protocols (to lend against, trade, etc.) at whatever level of granularity you wish, through explicit permissioning.</li><li><strong>Access</strong> to these things <em>whenever</em> you want&#x2014;including moving your assets to different DeFi protocols at any time&#x2014;enabled by 24/7/365 operations.</li><li><strong>Access</strong> to the underlying infrastructure, allowing <em>creation</em> of new financial products and services, enabled by the permissionless nature of public chains.</li></ul><p>It&#x2019;s important to realize, however, that not all of this accessibility is achieved at once. Instead, it happens in fits and starts as technology evolves.</p><p>When Bitcoin launched in 2009, it was the first time any asset was made globally accessible to anyone with internet access at any time. With the launch of Ethereum in 2015, smart contracts enabled anyone to easily create <em>new</em> digital assets with similar accessibility. While tremendously powerful, these digital assets were disconnected from the &#x2018;real world&#x2019; and thus often suffered from significant volatility and speculation.</p><p>Tether changed this. Unlike &#x2018;digitally-native&#x2019; assets, Tether leveraged blockchain technology to make exposure to a widely desired, high-quality, and stable asset from the real world&#x2014;the US dollar&#x2014;available to a global audience. Circle followed suit with USDC shortly thereafter. Since then, stablecoin usage has skyrocketed, with over $210 billion of stablecoins now circulating on public blockchains (Source: <a href="https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries?ref=blog.ondo.finance">RWA.xyz</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/02/Stablecoin-Growth-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Wall Street 2.0: Towards the Open Economy" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Stablecoin-Growth-1.png 600w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Stablecoin-Growth-1.png 1000w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/Stablecoin-Growth-1.png 1600w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/02/Stablecoin-Growth-1.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The driving force behind this success is, once again, <em>access</em>&#x2014;in this case, access to the US dollar. We in the US often take such access for granted. But for billions of people around the world living in countries with unstable currencies or despotic regimes, access to a stable and reliable asset like the dollar has been both desperately desired and difficult to obtain. Capital controls, frictions in opening a US bank account, and high foreign-currency exchange fees often made getting access practically impossible. Stablecoins have changed this. By leveraging blockchain technology, they make the US dollar accessible to anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world. Combine that with all of the other benefits that the blockchain enables&#x2014;near-instant settlement, 24/7/365 access, and the ability to self-custody&#x2014;and for many people in the world, stablecoins truly are a &#x201C;10x&#x201D; better solution.</p><h3 id="before-the-breakthrough"><strong>Before the Breakthrough</strong></h3><p>As US dollar-backed stablecoins gained traction, it became clear that the same blockchain features enabling better access to the US dollar could also be applied to other &apos;real-world&apos; assets (RWAs). However, early attempts to bring RWAs onchain faced significant challenges and struggled to gain widespread adoption for several reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Timing.</strong> A well-functioning market requires a sufficient number of participants. At the time, however, the technology was not yet proven enough for institutional investors, and many early crypto adopters were either focused on aggressive speculation of highly volatile digitally native tokens or were simply happy to finally be able to hold their wealth in a stable source of value through stablecoins.</li><li><strong>Lack of Utility.</strong> Beyond simply buying and holding, there were limited use cases for tokenized assets. Without a robust ecosystem to support lending, borrowing, trading, or yield generation, tokenized RWAs often became simply digital representations of value without much practical purpose. While the ability to &#x2018;buy and hold&#x2019; does have inherent value, vibrant financial markets depend on the ability to dynamically deploy assets to create liquidity, generate returns, and facilitate transactions.</li><li><strong>Focus on Alternative Assets.</strong> Early tokenization efforts often targeted illiquid assets like loans and private funds, assuming that blockchain&#x2019;s ability to enable fast, cheap settlement would improve their liquidity. However, liquidity in these assets is constrained not by technology but by deeper issues like information asymmetry, lack of fungibility, pricing challenges, and issuer resistance to liquid secondary markets. As a result, these efforts failed to gain significant traction.</li></ul><p>For these reasons, tokenization efforts outside of stablecoins remained largely pilot exercises to demonstrate feasibility.&#xA0;</p><h3 id="time-for-tokenization-the-emergence-of-yieldcoins"><strong>Time for Tokenization: The Emergence of Yieldcoins</strong></h3><p>In 2022, with rising interest rates in the real world and falling rates onchain, we identified in US Treasuries the first opportunity to tokenize securities that had a clear and immediate need. We tokenized US Treasuries to provide the market with a better alternative to conventional stablecoins&#x2014;one that preserved the global real-time transferability and onchain programmability of stablecoins, while paying holders a yield.&#xA0;</p><p>To do this well, we knew we needed to focus on creating <em>institutional-grade</em> products. To us, &#x201C;institutional-grade&#x201D; meant (a) built and operated with security and transparency as bedrock principles; (b) designed for regulatory compliance; (c) thoughtfully structured, both in terms of cost-effectiveness and investor protections; and (d) supported by world-class customer and user experience. We also knew that &#x201C;products&#x201D; didn&#x2019;t <em>just</em> mean tokenized assets; it also meant the <em>protocols</em> that would add utility to those assets and the <em>infrastructure</em> to enable all of this to work together securely, reliably, and seamlessly.</p><p>We started with <a href="https://ondo.finance/ousg?ref=blog.ondo.finance"><u>OUSG</u></a>. Built for institutional investors worldwide, we designed the token with embedded transfer restrictions, ensuring that only clients who successfully passed our KYC process could hold it. This design facilitated compliance with regulations. It also provided comfort to investors concerned about blockchain security and loss of funds; even if an investor were to be hacked, we would only ever redeem OUSG tokens to a verified party. We invested OUSG&#x2019;s assets in a Treasuries ETF managed by BlackRock, the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager. We partnered with best-in-class service providers and we provided daily transparency reporting into the full holdings and financials of the underlying fund, validated by a third-party fund administrator.</p><p>We also began to consider how users might access <em>utility</em> for their tokens beyond just buying and holding. So we developed <a href="https://fluxfinance.com/?ref=blog.ondo.finance"><u>Flux Finance</u></a> (later sold to the Ondo Foundation and launched by the Ondo DAO), the first onchain Treasury repo market. Flux allows any OUSG tokenholder to pledge their tokens as collateral to borrow stablecoins. To support OUSG&#x2019;s regulatory compliance&#x2014;to ensure it was <em>institutional grade</em>&#x2014;Flux was also the first DeFi protocol to support permissioned securities and ensure that fOUSG (the receipt token an OUSG tokenholder received in return for pledging their OUSG) could also only be transferred to those investors eligible to hold OUSG.</p><p>We then innovated again to ensure investors could get access <em>when</em> they wanted, by introducing <em>instant</em> minting and redeeming of OUSG tokens&#x2014;24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. To make OUSG even more accessible, we also lowered the minimum subscription or redemption size from $100,000 to just $5,000.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>While these innovations were a great first step, access to OUSG was still limited to high net-worth and institutional investors. This is why we then launched <a href="https://ondo.finance/usdy?ref=blog.ondo.finance" rel="noreferrer"><u>USDY</u></a>, the first freely transferable yieldcoin, designed to be accessible to retail investors outside the US.</p><p>Like OUSG, USDY maintains institutional-grade standards. It requires KYC verification for non-US persons to mint or redeem tokens, with daily third-party verification of reserves. It maintains a quarterly target of 3% over-collateralization, and is designed for robust bankruptcy protections with a third-party verification agent and collateral agent. Unlike OUSG, however, USDY tokens can be transferred and held freely (outside the US and subject to certain jurisdictional and other restrictions) and can be purchased by retail investors directly from us in amounts as low as $500. And, like OUSG&#x2014;but unlike stablecoins&#x2014;USDY pays tokenholders yield just for holding it.</p><p><strong>The Importance of Being &#x201C;Institutional Grade&#x201D;</strong></p><blockquote>Institutional investors and asset managers operate in a highly regulated environment where reliability, security, compliance, and scalability are non-negotiable. To move onchain, these investors demand that our solutions meet the same levels of thoughtfulness, transparency, compliance, and service they expect from existing financial systems.</blockquote><blockquote>At Ondo, we ensure that everything we build meets those demanding standards. No matter the dimension&#x2014;from the design of our products to the partners we choose &#x2014;we take extra care to ensure that what we do is best-in-class.</blockquote><p>While the launch of USDY brought exposure to US Treasuries to a much broader audience, it was initially only available on Ethereum and still lacked utility beyond its stability and yield. So we focused on expanding USDY access across many chains, including Ethereum, <a href="https://blog.ondo.finance/ecosystem-partners-for-usdy-on-solana/" rel="noreferrer"><u>Solana</u></a>, <a href="https://blog.ondo.finance/ondos-wave-of-tokenization-meets-suis-expanding-sea/"><u>Sui</u></a>, <a href="https://blog.ondo.finance/usdy-goes-live-on-aptos/"><u>Aptos</u></a>, <a href="https://www.mantle.xyz/blog/announcements/rwa-backed-usdy-live-on-mantle-musd-to-follow?ref=blog.ondo.finance"><u>Mantle</u></a>, <a href="https://blog.ondo.finance/usdy-goes-live-on-noble-high-quality-yield-across-the-cosmos-ecosystem/"><u>Noble</u></a>, and <a href="https://blog.ondo.finance/usdy-goes-live-on-arbitrum/"><u>Arbitrum</u></a>. We then built the <a href="https://ondo.finance/bridge?ref=blog.ondo.finance" rel="noreferrer"><u>Ondo Bridge</u></a>, allowing users to seamlessly (<a href="https://docs.ondo.finance/tools/ondo-bridge?ref=blog.ondo.finance"><u>and more securely</u></a>) move their assets from one chain to another. In parallel, the composability of USDY enabled its integration by a broad range of partners custodians, DEXs, lending protocols, exchanges, perpetuals, payments providers, and more. (See the <u>E</u><a href="https://ondo.finance/ecosystem?ref=blog.ondo.finance"><u>cosystem page</u></a> of our website for more details.)</p><p>We&#x2019;ve also seen tremendous growth within the yieldcoin sector as a whole. Many other companies have entered the space, including major traditional financial institutions like BlackRock and Wellington Management, attracting additional users and capital. Indeed, since the launch of OUSG 24 months ago, the total value of US Treasuries-backed products has reached almost $3.5 billion onchain (Source: <a href="https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries?ref=blog.ondo.finance">RWA.xyz</a>). By comparison, it took about 58 months after the launch of USDT for stablecoins to hit that same level.</p><p>We view this as a success. Bringing financial markets onchain is a collaborative effort that requires contributions from many stakeholders. Our approach has always been to develop platforms, assets, and infrastructure necessary to catalyze the movement of others into the space, whether simply by inspiring them to &#x201C;join the movement&#x201D; or by working with them directly.</p><p>As one example, we announced a new initiative of ours called Ondo Nexus, designed to utilize our OUSG instant minting and redemption technology to enable instant liquidity for issuers of <em>other</em> stablecoins and yieldcoins. As part of this initiative, we are diversifying the backing of OUSG to include yieldcoins from Franklin Templeton, Wellington, and WisdomTree, while leveraging liquidity from our existing relationships with BlackRock, PayPal, and others. We recently provided some public details with Wellington and FundBridge regarding their planned use of Nexus.&#xA0;</p><p>We love this example because it highlights so much of what we&#x2019;ve been talking about: enabling instant redemption (improving access in <em>time</em>) to more people (improving access in <em>reach</em>) via more providers (improving access in <em>choice</em>), all enabled by the composability of tokenized assets.</p><h2 id="welcome-to-wall-street-20"><strong>Welcome to Wall Street 2.0</strong></h2><p>The industry finds itself at a pivotal moment. Stablecoins have been a tremendous success, with over $210 billion worth in circulation today. DeFi has flourished, providing significant utility for digital assets. User adoption has surged, driving demand for digital assets that can serve as both stable stores of value and sources of yield. Yieldcoins have demonstrated substantial growth (and are poised, we think, to take substantial market share from traditional stablecoins). Large traditional asset managers are beginning to bring their assets onchain. Yet despite this progress, the current investing experience for so many around the globe is still broken.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why we believe that now is the time to bring a broader array of institutional-grade RWAs onchain.</p><p>To be clear, this market is enormous. There are over $867 trillion in traditional financial assets that can benefit from tokenization (source: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/07/world-economic-forum-blockchain-could-disrupt-867t-in-traditional-markets?ref=blog.ondo.finance" rel="noreferrer">CoinDesk</a>). If done correctly&#x2014;if done in an institutional-grade way&#x2014;both the opportunity and the impact will be tremendous.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>To better assess the impact of blockchain technology and asset tokenization on financial markets, it&apos;s helpful to first consider how modern financial markets&#x2014;epitomized by Wall Street&#x2014;have evolved over time.</p><p>Wall Street traces its origins to 1792, when 24 stockbrokers signed the Buttonwood Agreement, laying the foundation for what would become the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In those early days, financial transactions relied on manual processes and face-to-face trading. Deals were struck on trading floors, and extensive paperwork was required to finalize transactions. A web of intermediaries, including brokers and banks, was essential to facilitate these trades. This system was marked by high costs, limited transparency, and restricted accessibility.</p><p>The 20th century ushered in a wave of innovations that began to modernize the way Wall Street operated. The stock ticker, introduced in 1867, dramatically improved market communications, and the advent of the telephone in the late 19th century enabled faster information exchange. By the mid-20th century, advancements like the automation of trading-floor data signaled a shift toward more efficient systems. The 1970s saw the rise of electronic trading platforms, replacing traditional floor trading with digital systems that improved speed and accuracy. In the 1990s, the advent of the internet democratized access to financial information, reducing barriers for retail investors and lowering transaction costs. And most recently, high-frequency trading has driven liquidity and efficiency to new heights and the fintech boom has improved front-end user experiences for retail investors.</p><p>Yet, for all these advancements, the core structure of financial markets has remained largely unchanged. Centralized systems still dominate, with data siloed in proprietary databases and processes reliant on intermediaries to reconcile and settle trades. While digitization reduced some operational costs and streamlined processes, the fundamental structure&#x2014;one reliant on intermediaries, opaque data flows, and restricted access&#x2014;still persists.</p><p>Tokenization of real-world assets on public blockchains will change this. By making assets more accessible, transparent, and interoperable, tokenization represents a material improvement to the way financial markets function. It unlocks the potential for real-time settlement, reduced costs, and global accessibility while preserving the integrity and trust that traditional systems have long provided.</p><p>Importantly, unlike many of the early acolytes of blockchain technology, we don&#x2019;t believe that this will result in the creation of a separate, techno-anarchist version of financial markets that operates outside of regulations, destroys all incumbent players, and fundamentally alters the way capital markets operate. Instead, we believe that blockchain technology represents a substantial advance in the infrastructure on which financial markets run, which materially improves efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. You might call it a <em>foundational upgrade</em>.</p><p>We call it <em>Wall Street 2.0</em>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdVByVp0fugdV-C8UibYJDaEWCMNDmGOroSc8igURjz2rqoYKH6zflsfI22Tyo33oWgAdFUeTtkn_noy1wysX67XUKDnpEzajrgLIK0pAowl6ue6SCQTiMspbXjTiJ1Y-glHTSa?key=_1WPWAejxnRij_L9f2ezplNK" class="kg-image" alt="Wall Street 2.0: Towards the Open Economy" loading="lazy" width="624" height="351"></figure><p>Wall Street 2.0 represents the next evolution of financial markets, where traditional systems converge with blockchain technology to create a more accessible, efficient, and inclusive ecosystem. Unlike the legacy financial infrastructure, which is siloed, slow, and heavily reliant on intermediaries, Wall Street 2.0 leverages tokenization, smart contracts, and decentralized protocols to enable seamless access to a wider range of assets, real-time settlement, and automated compliance. This new paradigm empowers both institutions and individuals to transact, invest, and build financial products with unprecedented speed, transparency, and flexibility&#x2014;democratizing access to financial opportunities and lowering barriers to entry.</p><p>Consider just a few ways Wall Street 2.0 will benefit stakeholders:</p><p><em><strong>Investors</strong> will get access to:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Global Assets.</strong> Imagine you want to diversify your portfolio with foreign stocks or bonds. Today, you have to navigate currency exchanges, manage foreign brokerage accounts, and deal with different regulatory environments. On Wall Street 2.0, you can seamlessly invest in tokenized versions of foreign assets on a decentralized platform. With just a few clicks, you&#x2019;ll have a globally diversified portfolio without the hassle.</li><li><strong>24/7/365 Markets.</strong> Say you&#x2019;re trading Asian equities and you see a compelling opportunity, so you want to exit one of your US-based positions held at a different broker. Today, you may need to wait until US markets open to make the trade. Even then, accessing the cash from that sale could take days or more, tying up capital and increasing your costs due to potential currency fluctuations and fees. On Wall Street 2.0, can sell the token representing that US position at any time and settle in seconds. You&#x2019;ll be able to access and reinvest your funds almost immediately, making it easier to react to market changes without waiting on outdated financial infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Better Rates.</strong> Let&#x2019;s say you (as a retail investor) have your portfolio at Schwab and want to borrow money against it. Today, you either have to borrow at whatever rate Schwab offers you or have to move your entire portfolio to another broker&#x2014;often a multi-day process; you have no easy way to &#x201C;shop around&#x201D; for the best rate. On Wall Street 2.0, with a click of a button you can find the best rate across a range of lending protocols and quickly pledge your assets to get cash.</li><li><strong>New Investment Opportunities.</strong> If you&#x2019;re a retail investor in traditional markets today, you are mostly limited to the existing financial products and strategies offered by your broker. On Wall Street 2.0, you can not only access (or create!) strategies not historically available to retail investors, but also earn fundamentally new types of yield (e.g., staking your securities for network security and getting paid a portion of the transaction fees). There are also opportunities to combine the best of digitally native and real-world assets (e.g., seamlessly cross-collateralizing staked ETH with tokenized securities to optimize borrowing rates).</li></ul><p><em><strong>Asset Managers</strong> will get access to:</em></p><ul><li><strong>More Efficient Fund Administration.</strong> Imagine you&apos;re an asset manager looking to launch a fund. Traditionally, this involves coordinating with multiple intermediaries and bearing significant administrative costs. On Wall Street 2.0, you can issue a fund token with other tokenized assets as the underlying, reducing overhead and administrative burden.</li><li><strong>Broader Reach.</strong> Imagine you&#x2019;re an asset manager wanting to attract investors from around the world. Today, regulatory barriers and jurisdictional complexities can make this difficult. On Wall Street 2.0, you can issue tokenized assets that comply with regulatory requirements and reach qualified investors globally through DeFi platforms, expanding your reach.</li><li><strong>Easier Compliance.</strong> Imagine you&#x2019;re overseeing compliance for your fund, with constant KYC updates, AML checks, and reports to regulators&#x2014;an endless paperwork challenge. On Wall Street 2.0, your tokenized assets have compliance rules baked into their smart contracts. These automations handle investor eligibility and ensure adherence to regulatory standards. Reporting is easier too, as investors can view asset performance, portfolio composition, and risk metrics anytime, without waiting for quarterly updates.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Developers</strong> will get access to:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Easy Integration.</strong> If you want to build an application on top of today&#x2019;s financial system, it&#x2019;s a maze of permissions, access requests, and API integrations. Every step involves securing authorizations from banks, navigating opaque systems, and working through intermediaries to access user data. On Wall Street 2.0, that complexity is drastically reduced. By leveraging decentralized finance protocols, you can seamlessly tap into an ecosystem where assets, data, and services are open and interoperable. This streamlined access enables you to develop and deploy financial applications faster, eliminating the traditional gatekeeping that slows innovation.</li><li><strong>More Assets.</strong> Imagine developing an app where users can manage portfolios, but you&#x2019;re limited to digital assets, which can be volatile and restrict who might use your product. In Wall Street 2.0, you can integrate tokenized real-world assets&#x2014;like stocks, bonds, and ETFs&#x2014;directly into your app, providing more stable options and expanding your user base. This flexibility lets you create applications that appeal to both retail and institutional investors looking for a wider range of asset choices.</li><li><strong>Built-in Compliance.</strong> Imagine you&#x2019;re creating a financial app. It needs to include compliance checks like KYC/AML, which adds manual work and operational costs. On Wall Street 2.0, you can embed compliance rules directly into smart contracts, allowing user verification and transaction monitoring to occur automatically. This built-in automation ensures regulatory adherence with minimal friction, giving you the flexibility to scale your app while reducing the burden of regulatory overhead.</li></ul><p>These are just some of the things that are possible on Wall Street 2.0. By fostering real-time transactions, interoperable assets, instant compliance, and accessible investment options, this evolution will equip investors, asset managers, and developers alike with tools to transact, trade, and collaborate with new freedom.</p><h2 id="bridging-the-gap"><strong>Bridging the Gap</strong></h2><p>To be clear, we&#x2019;re only at the start of this new world, with much work yet to do. For example, it&#x2019;s certainly the case that issuing and managing a tokenized version of a real-world asset today is <em>more</em> expensive than its non-tokenized counterpart; until infrastructure and legal structures further mature, operations and accounting of tokenized assets have to happen both in the real-world <em>and</em> onchain. While there are <em>other</em> benefits of holding tokenizing assets, at least today lower costs are not typically one of them. While becoming increasingly favorable, there is still a multitude of global legal and regulatory regimes that need to be navigated, which can both restrict access and add frictions to asset issuers, protocols, and investors alike. The underlying technologies, though rapidly advancing, still have room to improve across many dimensions, including speed, cost, security, and user experience. The operational challenges of bridging a world that operates instantly, globally, and 24/7/365 with a world that does not are often nuanced and complex. User interfaces are often still clunky and ill-suited for mass adoption. And the business models of many providers in the ecosystem are still unproven, with many stakeholders still uncertain where&#x2014;and to whom&#x2014;value will accrue.</p><p>For almost two years, we&#x2019;ve been deeply focused on addressing these challenges and bringing institutional-grade RWAs onchain. One key realization we&#x2019;ve had is that building robust capital markets onchain requires focusing not just on the assets, but also on the infrastructure that underpins the entire market. As we&#x2019;ve said from the beginning, this undertaking is far too big to accomplish alone&#x2014;it requires the support and collaboration of many key partners to build an ecosystem that can bring this vision to life.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why, over the past year or so, we&#x2019;ve been working hard to bring together the pieces&#x2014;the <em>assets</em>, the <em>infrastructure</em>, and the <em>ecosystem</em>&#x2014;to make this vision of onchain capital markets a reality.</p><h2 id="access-for-all-the-foundation-of-the-open-economy"><strong>Access for All: The Foundation of the Open Economy</strong></h2><p>Until now, we&#x2019;ve described the main benefit of blockchain technology as increasing access. But if we think about all of the features&#x2014;the ability to make, consume, use, and transfer financial assets wherever you want, whenever you want, all in an (appropriately) transparent way&#x2014;another word also comes to mind: <strong>open.</strong> What public blockchains enable&#x2014;what stablecoins have started and what Wall Street 2.0 represents&#x2014;is the beginning of the transition to <strong>a more open financial system.</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdvOl1zVD87QgSTmgfST31Wq0bfs7rAK4Ok1Nq9wxfoyDwe4QX6BnEYvyen-WUXUJtH57VvJu_UcBv7D32BXJfNTDB68udEfuyIWlJuHfO2fO5GWayjKtLdXank11OuCxyJYGrfPg?key=_1WPWAejxnRij_L9f2ezplNK" class="kg-image" alt="Wall Street 2.0: Towards the Open Economy" loading="lazy" width="624" height="351"></figure><p>We believe that this move towards a more open financial system is very much in line with the general thrust of the incoming US administration. As we have stated elsewhere, we understand and respect the need for regulation and investor protections. But we also believe that people should have access to high-quality, regulated financial assets and services, regardless of wealth or income level, and that people should have the right to move and use those assets easily and as they see fit. We believe that improving access to US financial assets is good for the US: DeFi will open up a broader array of financial services to individuals who previously could not afford them, and greater access to US assets will allow the global demand that already exists for them to finally be met. We also believe that broader access will enable more shared participation in the value that global supply chains bring: if a worker in Vietnam assembling Nike shoes can also own&#x2014;easily, instantly, and cheaply&#x2014;Nike stock and more fully participate in the value she creates, we think that&#x2019;s a good thing.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>We&#x2019;re tremendously excited about all of this, but it&#x2019;s only one part of a bigger shift we&#x2019;re seeing. The use of stablecoins and yieldcoins for cross-border remittances or <a href="https://blog.ondo.finance/case-study-bringing-utility-to-payments-with-usdy/"><u>point-of-sale payments</u></a> is reducing transaction costs and expanding access to the goods and services purchasable with these assets. The incredible advances in AI are increasing access to intelligence and low-cost knowledge work, not to mention the value creation and capture that will occur when AI starts earning and allocating capital onchain. And, of course, the bedrock of this all, the internet, has long been making information more accessible&#x2014;more open&#x2014;to all. This isn&#x2019;t just about a more open financial system&#x2014;it&#x2019;s also about broader access to goods, services, intelligence, and information. There&#x2019;s a word for that: the <em>economy</em>. The <em>open</em> economy.</p><p>The open economy is an idea that reaches beyond the financial system: it&#x2019;s a vision of a globally accessible system where goods, services, and information flow freely. Enabled by technology, the open economy moves us toward a world where barriers to accessing capital, goods, and information are minimized, empowering individuals and organizations to engage as producers, consumers, makers, and citizens in ways that historically have been out of reach for many.</p><p>This paradigm shift brings numerous benefits: universal access to goods and services through decentralized marketplaces, democratized access to information via blockchain-powered platforms, decentralized platforms for direct exchange of goods and knowledge, and enhanced privacy and security through cryptographically enhanced systems. By removing geographic and bureaucratic constraints, the open economy fosters economic inclusion, lowers barriers to knowledge and education, and gives individuals greater control over their personal data across various sectors including finance, healthcare, and education.</p><p>The open economy isn&#x2019;t just an evolution in how we access capital; it&#x2019;s a fundamental shift in how individuals and organizations globally engage with the entire spectrum of economic life. Yet a strong economy vitally <em>depends upon&#x2014;</em>and is <em>enabled by&#x2014;</em>its financial markets to support the efficient formation, allocation, and movement of capital; the management and distribution of risk; the facilitation of payments; the storage and growth of wealth; the provision liquidity and credit; the facilitation of price discovery; the support of economic activity; and the encouragement of entrepreneurship and innovation.</p><p><strong>Our mission is to accelerate the transition to the open economy by building the platforms, assets, and infrastructure to bring financial markets onchain.</strong></p><p>To reflect this updated mission, today we&#x2019;re introducing a new visual identity for our brand. You can explore this new look and feel on our <a href="https://ondo.finance/?ref=blog.ondo.finance"><u>website</u></a>.</p><p>We&#x2019;re incredibly excited to be on this journey. With the help of our clients, partners, and investors, we&#x2019;ve made tremendous strides towards our mission. But we think the best is yet to come. With accessible goods and services, open information flows, and secure data ownership, the open economy is poised to reduce economic inequality, enhance productivity, and promote social mobility. From sourcing goods to finding work, gaining education, securing health data, and (of course) accessing and deploying capital, the open economy enables individuals everywhere to participate more fully and equally in the economic aspects of our global society&#x2014;making it fairer, faster, and more accessible to all.</p><p>Onward.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/02/USDY---OUSG-Joint-Disclaimer---General.png" class="kg-image" alt="Wall Street 2.0: Towards the Open Economy" loading="lazy" width="1476" height="165" srcset="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/USDY---OUSG-Joint-Disclaimer---General.png 600w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/USDY---OUSG-Joint-Disclaimer---General.png 1000w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/02/USDY---OUSG-Joint-Disclaimer---General.png 1476w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ondo Finance Expands Institutional Reach with OUSG Deployment on the XRP Ledger]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/01/OUSG-Disclaimer--When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1476" height="236" srcset="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/OUSG-Disclaimer--When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned.png 600w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/OUSG-Disclaimer--When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned.png 1000w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2025/01/OUSG-Disclaimer--When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned.png 1476w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Ondo Finance will deploy Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG), its tokenized US Treasury fund, on the <a href="https://xrpl.org/?ref=blog.ondo.finance"><u>XRP Ledger (XRPL</u></a>), a decentralized layer-1 blockchain.

Yet hurdles remain for users and businesses alike:</p><ul><li><strong>Businesses:</strong> Businesses wanting to interact with, and accept crypto as a form of payment, typically do so via stablecoins. While stablecoins offer stability, they do not generate yield, leaving funds idle and unproductive. Businesses can utilize a cash management solution that goes beyond simple stability to deliver financial efficiency and returns on reserves, while not opening themselves up to the risk of volatile assets or smart contract risk.</li><li><strong>Users:</strong> End users wanting to utilize crypto often overlook opportunities to earn on idle funds, or they have them deployed in highly volatile tokens. They are unaware of the middle ground of liquid, idle assets that aren&#x2019;t far along the risk curve.&#xA0;</li></ul><p>Both groups need a payments infrastructure that combines the benefits of crypto&#x2014;speed, composability, and accessibility&#x2014;with tools that enable capital efficiency and flexible cash management.</p><h3 id="sphere-pay-bridging-traditional-and-onchain-payments"><strong>Sphere Pay: Bridging Traditional and Onchain Payments</strong></h3><p><strong>Sphere Pay</strong> is providing an operating system for the digital economy, transforming cross-border payments into secure, reliable experiences.

BounceBit is pioneering the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance with their CeDeFi model, and by offering US Treasury-backed assets like USDY, it has never been easier for anyone to tap into previously privileged financial products.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-09-at-3.51.25-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="BounceBit Integrates USDY as First Tokenized RWA on CeDeFi V2" loading="lazy" width="1248" height="784" srcset="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-09-at-3.51.25-PM.png 600w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w1000/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-09-at-3.51.25-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-09-at-3.51.25-PM.png 1248w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="tapping-into-the-usdy-vault-on-bouncebit">Tapping Into the USDY Vault on BounceBit</h3><p>Users can now access the USDY CeDeFi vault through BounceBit&apos;s dedicated interface and start earning yields in three simple steps:</p><ol><li>Visit the USDY vault in the RWA tab at <a href="https://app.bouncebit.io/vaults/usdy?ref=blog.ondo.finance"><u>app.bouncebit.io/vaults/usdy</u></a></li><li>Connect your wallet</li><li>Deploy your assets and start earning</li></ol><p>The integration in the BounceBit Platform is the first opportunity to tap into USDY via CeDeFi infrastructure, making yield opportunities as simple as any one-click retail finance application.

It is accessible to non-US individual and institutional investors and is designed to combine the accessibility of stablecoins with high-quality, US dollar-denominated yield. Key features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Broad Accessibility</strong>: Tokenized loan that can trade globally in secondary markets to non-US investors</li><li><strong>Yield</strong>: Accrues a variable interest rate, adjusted monthly by the issuer. Yield accrues in the form of a redemption value that increases over time</li><li><strong>Daily Liquidity</strong>: Non-US investors can both mint and redeem USDY on a daily basis</li><li><strong>High-Quality Collateral</strong>: Secured by short-term US Treasuries under control agreements</li><li><strong>Regulatory Compliance Focus</strong>: Offered and sold in a continuous Regulation S offering to non-US investors; issuer has a money services business registration with the US Treasury&#x2019;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</li><li><strong>Bankruptcy-Remoteness</strong>: Assets designed to be ring-fenced from a hypothetical Ondo bankruptcy</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[RWAs You Can Use For Savings: USDY in Your Wallet]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2024/12/USDY-Disclaimer---When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1600" height="545" srcset="https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/USDY-Disclaimer---When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/size/w1000/2024/12/USDY-Disclaimer---When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.ondo.finance/content/images/2024/12/USDY-Disclaimer---When-Third-Party-Products--Services-or-Tech-Mentioned-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The onchain economy is alive and thriving, supporting a wide range of users and activities.

While social media often spotlights onchain traders taking volatile swings while trading memecoins, crypto rails also serve a crucial role in providing financial solutions for those without traditional bank access. Between these two user profiles, a common gap exists despite the wildly different approaches they have to onchain finance: the understanding of where they can turn for reliable, yield-generating savings.</p><h3 id="the-savings-challenge-across-the-onchain-spectrum">The Savings Challenge Across the Onchain Spectrum</h3><p>These two distinct groups face similar cash management challenges, though from vastly different perspectives:</p><ul><li><strong>Unbanked Users:</strong> Many people rely on crypto for financial services due to having limited or no access to traditional banking rails. For this group, managing cash onchain as a substitute for a checking account is essential, yet there is a lack of awareness and guidance on suitable, dependable savings tools.</li><li><strong>Onchain Traders:</strong> A different end of the spectrum is represented by the active traders who live onchain, who do most of their activities through tools like Phantom&#x2019;s multichain wallet. These users often lack concrete cash management/wealth preservation plans, with a keen focus on high-risk, high-reward strategies. Even holding small portions of their funds in a yield-bearing asset could prove beneficial to future selves.</li></ul><p>In crypto, savings management is often overlooked and misunderstood. For the unbanked, it&#x2019;s the complexity of DeFi and yield strategies that scare them away. Using crypto typically means having a &apos;digital checking account&apos;, with no tools for compounding. For the onchain degens, they possess an aversion to stowing away funds in a preservation strategy.</p><p>If only there was a simple option to remain flexible onchain and begin accruing yield on idle balances. Ondo Finance&#x2019;s mission to provide institutional-grade assets onchain, for everyone, provides a solution that fills this gap for both parties. Tokenized US Treasuries like USDY offer users a simple yet effective savings vehicle, with complete onchain flexibility.</p><h3 id="the-ondo-solution-usdy-for-onchain-savings">The Ondo Solution: USDY for Onchain Savings</h3><p>Ondo&#x2019;s tokenized US Treasuries, like USDY, combine the stability and returns of a traditional savings account with the 24/7 accessibility and composability of onchain assets. Widely available on Solana, with 14+ integrations bringing together the best of traditional finance with the flexibility and composability of crypto assets, USDY offers the unbanked a flexible, user-friendly way to grow their savings over time. And, for traders with little appetite for fully offramping their crypto, yield-bearing, composable RWAs like USDY serve as a means to &#x201C;take chips off the table&#x201D; without needing to &#x201C;exit the casino.&#x201D;</p><h3 id="tapping-into-ondo-rwas-within-the-solana-ecosystem">Tapping into Ondo RWAs Within the Solana Ecosystem</h3><p>When we look at tokenized US Treasuries products as a savings vehicle, ground zero for these tools to be accessible is a platform for asset management. To this end, the infrastructure is actually quite simple. It&#x2019;s crypto wallets, and on Solana, we can look at, and understand, the user profiles previously discussed through the lens of two different wallet solutions who serve different segments of the market.</p><ul><li><strong>Decaf Wallet:</strong> Tailored for LatAm users, many of whom are unbanked and in pursuit of accessible financial management. Decaf offers onramp and offramp solutions through easy-to-access integrations with MoneyGram and has proven to be a useful app as a checking account substitute. And it&#x2019;s only one step further to access onchain savings. Users of wallets like Decaf can tap into Ondo&#x2019;s USDY with fee-less swaps to provide an accessible, flexible savings solution that can be accessed anytime, giving them a simple, low-risk opportunity to grow their funds.</li><li><strong>Phantom Wallet:</strong> Known for its appeal among active traders, users who live  onchain via their Phantom wallet can tap into a liquid savings option through USDY. Traders can move a portion of their holdings-of-the-week into this yield-bearing asset, allowing them to take meaningful profits and practice effective cash management while remaining fully onchain and liquid with no added smart contract risk.</li></ul><h3 id="ondo%E2%80%99s-rwas-provide-a-sustainable-path">Ondo&#x2019;s RWAs Provide a Sustainable Path</h3><p>Ondo&#x2019;s tokenized US Treasuries are straightforward and accessible&#x2014;capturing native yield in a composable asset with a broad suite of liquid integrations. USDY is especially well-suited for users looking for onchain savings solutions, and its widespread deployment on Solana makes it highly flexible. Composable, easy-to-use, and designed with financial growth in mind.</p><p>Flexible RWAs like USDY deliver more than yield&#x2014;they bring forth a new chasm of possibilities for onchain savings and financial management, accessible to all. Yieldcoins represent a stable way to store and grow wealth for the unbanked, while offering a path to financial stability without sacrificing flexibility for onchain traders. Whether through Decaf, Phantom, or another Solana wallet, Ondo&#x2019;s RWAs are redefining what it means to bank yourself onchain. <em>With RWAs you can use for savings.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ondo Monthly Spotlight: November 2024]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Monthly Spotlight from Ondo Finance, where we delve into the latest developments from the forefront of real-world asset tokenization.

The fragmented, multichain nature of blockchain ecosystems means that onchain tokenized assets must be able to seamlessly bridge across isolated blockchains. This requires solutions that ensure security-first, cross-chain transferability. But existing bridging solutions often rely on a single messaging protocol, creating a centralized point of trust. To meet institutional standards, we developed a solution with redundant security and risk controls at the smart contract level, eliminating single points of failure and enabling a security-first, composable future for tokenized real-world assets.</p><p>In collaboration with LayerZero, we built the first institutional-grade RWA bridging solution. LayerZero&#x2019;s Application-Owned Security Model enables us to configure a security stack with a diverse set of isolated Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs), including our own bespoke DVN, that independently verify the integrity of each message sent across chains in what we call Multi-Messaging Aggregation (MMA).

In addition, to further enhance security, we are implementing our own Ondo DVN with Ondo-specific validation built in as an explicit-use redundancy.

<h3 id="institutional-grade-security-with-decentralized-verifier-networks-dvns"><strong>Institutional-Grade Security with Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs)</strong></h3><p>Last year we rolled out V1 of the Ondo bridge, which enabled Ethereum to Mantle transfers. With this, we were one of the first MMA Bridge implementations, relying on shared security between the Axelar Network and Ondo Finance&#x2019;s off-chain systems to relay and attest messages and ensure the validity of transactions being performed. While this was a best-in-class security solution at the time, we want tokenized RWAs to be available <em>everywhere, </em>and this scale requires a deeper focus on isolated security without a single point of failure.</p><p>In our mission of making tokenized RWAs broadly available, we believe bridging built around MMA with a <em>diverse</em> set of verification mechanisms and message passing protocols is the most secure and flexible method. The LayerZero protocol allows applications to leverage immutable smart contracts and configure a custom security stack, utilizing a bespoke selection of DVNs to verify message integrity. This approach enables us to achieve a more scalable and flexible solution, extending across diverse ecosystems.</p><p>The new bridge is the first MMA bridge of its kind, aggregating attestations via ZK proofs with Polyhedra, an industry-leading bridge protocol in LayerZero Labs, and a PoS blockchain in Axelar. <a href="https://docs.zkbridge.com/zkbridge-trustless-cross-chain-bridges-made-practical/introducing-zkbridge-protocol?ref=blog.ondo.finance"><u>Polyhedra</u></a> offers mathematical certainty of bridge events via zero-knowledge proofs, while <a href="https://docs.axelar.dev/learn/security/?ref=blog.ondo.finance"><u>Axelar</u></a> is a battle tested Proof-of-Stake blockchain purpose-built for General Message Passing. Axelar has securely transmitted over 2 billion messages, representing more than $9 billion in volume. The distinct network of isolated DVNs seeks to minimize the risk of any single point of failure and offer robust, adaptable security. The configurability of the OFT framework allows us to evolve alongside the industry, enabling the addition of new verification mechanisms and interoperability protocols as DVNs, when they become available.</p><h3 id="building-redundancies-for-enhanced-security"><strong>Building Redundancies for Enhanced Security</strong></h3><p>Beyond the diverse DVN stack and isolated security of the LayerZero implementation, we want security measures that are specific to our institutional-grade products. To this effect, we are implementing additional redundancies to ensure a best-in-class bridging solution, including the Ondo DVN, designed with a focus on client diversity and tailored specifically for validation of Ondo assets.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Ondo&#x2019;s Decentralized Verifier Network: </strong>Software diversity and trust alignment are essential principles in blockchain security. When multiple attestors in a security stack run the same software, a single bug or malicious dependency can compromise the entire system, potentially leading to false mints. While the inherent diversity provided by Polyhedra, LayerZero, and Axelar already helps mitigate this risk, we are elevating our security model with the Ondo DVN, which will be built upon our proprietary off-chain verification mechanisms from the original Ondo Bridge.</p><p>This DVN will have explicit instructions to verify the burn of bridged Ondo assets (OUSG, USDY) in concurrence with the minting of those assets on the target network, and establishes asset supply integrity for Ondo Finance, a feature not included in other general DVNs.</p><p>Given that the entire aggregation stack is required for message attestation, Ondo becomes a necessary signer in the process. In deploying our own DVN, we reduce the trust assumptions involved in omnichain transfers, allowing users to rely on the trust they already place in us for token issuance while minimizing dependence on third parties.</p><p><strong>Rate Limiting at the Smart Contract Layer:</strong> In collaboration with the LayerZero team, we&#x2019;ve implemented a first-of-its-kind inbound and outbound rate limiting at the smart contract level. These rate limits provide a crucial layer of defense and further mitigate any risk, preventing the overminting of unauthorized tokens, thereby reducing the likelihood of a catastrophic attack on the solvency of the token issuers, in the highly unlikely event of a widespread compromise of the security stack.</p><p><strong>Emergency Freeze: </strong>As an added measure of security, we&#x2019;ve built an emergency pause feature directly into the contracts to decrease incident response latency in the case of a system malfunction.</p><h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-next-for-ondo"><strong>What&#x2019;s Next for Ondo?</strong></h3><p>With a premier solution for secure omnichain growth, Ondo will open RWA access to more users and liquidity, setting the stage for Ondo Global Markets. Core to the Global Markets vision is remedying the problem of liquidity deserts for tokenized assets. With our LayerZero-enabled bridge design, we are demonstrating how tokenized assets can overcome this challenge by securely tapping into omnichain liquidity environments. Ondo&#x2019;s tokenized treasuries are already live across 8 chains, and we plan to continue expanding bridge support to make our assets both interoperable and available on more chains in the coming months.&#xA0;</p><hr>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
